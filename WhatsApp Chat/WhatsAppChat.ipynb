AB de Villiers, the 360° cricketer, has joined us as a volunteer and funder to help create larger impact ❤\\n\\nWhen you become a volunteer you get to work with children in Child Care Institutions. How? You can volunteer with us to teach them subjects like English/ Math. There is also an option to volunteer as a mentor to youth who are above the age of 16 and help with their goals and aspirations! There are also more roles like Fundraising, Campaign Volunteering in case you are not sure of working with children directly!  \\n\\nWhile you strive with a community to empower children and youth, as a MADster you’ll upskill yourself in different avenues and connect to a network of change makers! The duration I have spent as a MADster has been that of learning and witnessing how every action makes an impact!  \\n\\nI genuinely believe that this can be your space and there could be a lot you can give to the children and youth! So join me in being part of this MADness! \\n\\nHere’s the link to apply : \\nhttps://makeadiff.in/apprenticeship/?userid=9405\\n\\nLet me know if you have any questions! Also, even if you can’t join us can I please request you to share this message in your groups? And friends? It might reach someone who has been looking for an opportunity!\\n',\n",
